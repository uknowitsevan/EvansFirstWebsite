                <p>I really like creating and writing. My dad works for Rawlco Radio in Regina and produces and writes advertisements. I think that would be a really fun job. I like the idea of makeing videos with effects and nice editing. Yah, I really like Editing, or I might want to be a journalist. Iv'e also thought about housing for a job before too. </p>
